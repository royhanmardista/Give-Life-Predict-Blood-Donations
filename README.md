# Give-Life-Predict-Blood-Donations
Building a binary classifier to predict if a blood donor is likely to donate again.  In this Project, we will work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors. The task will be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window. we will look at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to using the tpot library to automate Machine Learning pipeline
